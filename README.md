# 👋 Hi, I'm Mateus Diniz

Frontend Developer (Junior) with a strong focus on **UX/UI**, currently working with **web interfaces** from design to implementation.

I work professionally creating **user-centered layouts in Figma** and developing the **frontend of web systems**, integrating with **backend APIs written in C#**. I enjoy bridging design and development to build interfaces that are both functional and intuitive.

Alongside my professional experience, I develop **personal projects using JavaScript and React**, where I practice component-based architecture, state management and responsive design. My goal is to grow as a **Frontend / UX UI Developer**, especially in environments that value good user experience and clean frontend architecture.

🌱 Currently improving my skills in **React and modern frontend practices**  
📍 Based in Brazil  
🎯 Open to opportunities as **Frontend / UX UI Junior**
